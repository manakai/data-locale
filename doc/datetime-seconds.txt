* Structure

The file contains a JSON object with following name/value pair:

  negative_leap_seconds [object]
  positive_leap_seconds [object]

    Names are leap seconds and values are their descriptions.  Leap
    seconds are represented by the HTML valid normalized forced-UTC
    global date and time string of the second, except that the second

    HTML).  The second component of a negative leap second is 59.
    Values are JSON objects with following name/value pairs:

      next [string]

        The next second of the leap second, in HTML valid normalized
        forced-UTC global date and time string.

      next_unix [number]

        The next second of the leap second, as a Unix time_t number
        (since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z).

      prev [string]

        The previous second of the leap second, in HTML valid
        normalized forced-UTC global date and time string.
