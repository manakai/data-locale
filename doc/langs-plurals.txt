Plural rules.

* Structure

The file contains a JSON object with following name/value pairs:

  forms [object]

    Definitions for plural forms referenced from plural rules.  Names
    are opaque strings identifying plural forms.  Values are their
    descriptions, represented as objects with following name/value
    pairs:

      examples [string]

        Example of numbers belonging to this plural form, represented
        as U+0020-separated list of non-negative integers with no
        leading zero.

      expression [plural-expression]

        An expression that returns true if and only if /n/ is a number
        that belongs to this plural form.

      typical [integer]

        A typical non-negative integer that belongs to this plural
        form.

  rules [object]

    Plural rules.  Names are opaque strings identifying plural rules.
    Values are their descriptions, represented as objects with
    following name/value pairs:

      expression [plural-expression]

        An expression that represents the plural rule.

      forms [array]

        The plural forms used in this plural rule.  The length of the
        array represents the number of the forms used in this plural
        rule.  The items of the array are the names of the plural
        forms used in this plural rule (i.e. names in the |forms|
        top-level object in the file).

      serializations [object]

        Known serializations of the plural rule.  In this data file, a
        plural rule is considered as a set of plural forms.  Plural
        rules in various wire formats are defined a list of plural
        forms, rather than a set.  Such variations of plural rule
        representations are considered as "serializations" of a set.
        Names are opaque strings identifying plural rule
        serializations.  Values are their descriptions, represented as
        objects with following name/value pairs:

          expressions [object]

            Expressions that represents the plural rule serialization,
            used in the wild.  Names are expressions and values are
            [boolean] true values.

          fields [string]

            Mapping from plural forms in the plural rules to plural
            form fields in the serializations.  The value is a
            U+002F-separated list of (zero-based) indexes or "-".  An
            index references the plural form in the |forms| array of
            the plural rule object, while "-" indicates that the field
            is not in fact used.

          mozilla_rule [integer?]

            The plural rule number used in Mozilla PluralForm
            implementation, as documented in
            <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Localization/Localization_and_Plurals>,
            if assigned.
