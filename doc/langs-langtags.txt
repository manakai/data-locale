* Extracting country codes

As the two-letter country codes and some three-letter country codes
are registered with IANA as language subtags, they can be extracted
from the |langtag.json| file.  They are included in |region| value of
the entire JSON object.

Two-letter country codes and its properties can be extracted by the
following jq filter:

  $ cat data/langtags.json | \
    ./jq ".region | to_entries | map(select(.key | length == 2)) | from_entries"

* Extracting currency codes

As the three-letter currency codes are registered as language tag "U"
extension subtags, they can be extracted from the |langtag.json| file.
They are included in |u_cu| value of the entire JSON object.

Three-letter country codes and its properties can be extracted by the
following jq filter:

  $ cat data/langtags.json | ./jq ".u_cu"
