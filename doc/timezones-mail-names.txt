~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[RFC2616] [son-of-RFC1036] [RSS2BP].

* Structure

The file contains a JSON object with following name/value pair:

  names [object]

    Names are time zone names and values are their descriptions.
    Names are in ASCII uppercase with no leading and trailing white
    spaces or comments, as names are ASCII case-insensitive in RFC 822
    [RFC822].  Names might contain space characters within them,
    although they are not allowed in RFC 822 names.  Spaces in a name
    is represented by a SPACE character.  Values are JSON objects with
    following name/value pairs:

      allowed_but_not_recommended_rss2 [boolean]

        Whether the time zone name is allowed (i.e. |allowed_rfc822|
        is true) and it is not RECOMMENDED according to the RSS Best
        Practices Profile [RSS2BP] or not.

      allowed_http [boolean]

        Whether the time zone name is allowed in HTTP [RFC1945]
        [RFC2068] [RFC2616] or not.
