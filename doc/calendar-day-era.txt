Files with "-filtered" in their names only contain an interesting
subset of days.  Files without such suffix contain all days in
relevant ranges.

These files are date mapping files
<https://manakai.github.io/spec-datetime/#date-mapping-file> from the
calendar days <https://manakai.github.io/spec-datetime/#calendar-day>
to the years.  Gregorian days are serialized as Gregorian date strings
<https://manakai.github.io/spec-datetime/#gregorian-date-string>.  If
the year can be represented in the era system, it is represented as an
era key followed by a U+0020 SPACE character followed by a decimal
integer representing the year in the era, using optional U+002D
HYPHEN-MINUS character followed by zero or more ASCII digits.
