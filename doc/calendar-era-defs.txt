      south_end_day [day?]
      south_end_year [year?]
      south_official_start_day [day?]
      south_actual_end_day [day?]

        The start and end of the era, if defined and known.

        The start or end of the era can be defined in terms of day or
        year.

        If the start or end is defined in terms of day, |start_day| or
        |end_day| is set to the value which should be used when a date
        represented in other format is converted into the era-based
        format (according to the era system "jp" for |jp_era| eras).

        If the start is defined in terms of day and there is an
        "official" start day, |official_start_day| is set to that day.
        It can be different from the |start_day| if the era was
        defined after its actual start day.  See also
        <https://wiki.suikawiki.org/n/%E5%85%83%E5%8F%B7#anchor-159>.

        If the end is defined in terms of day, |actual_end_day| is set
        to that day.  It can be different from the |end_day| if a new
        era had been started before the end of the |actual_end_day|.

        For eras with |jp_north_era| or |jp_south_era| flag, |north_|
        or |south_| prefixed name/value pairs are used instead, as
        their values can be different for 北朝 and 南朝.  Note that 正
        平の一統 is not reflected to these properties.  The
        |jp_north_era| flag is not set to the 正平 era.

        If the start or end is defined in terms of day, |start_year|
        or |end_year| is set to the year of the |start_day| or the
        |actual_end_day| in the "native" calendar.

        If the start or end is defined in terms of year, |start_year|
        or |end_year| is set to that year.

        If start or end is defined in terms of year, |start_*_day| and
        |end_*_day| name/value pairs, where * is |gregorian|,
        |julian|, or |kyuureki|, are set to the first or last days in
        those calendars.

        For values with type [day], the parameter /era/ is set to the
        era.

    Note that there is a special era: "unknown", which indicates that
    the era is unknown or not specified.

  name_conflicts

    List of eras which share same name but have different definitions.
    This is a JSON object whose names are conflicting era names and
    whose values are their descriptions, as JSON objects whose names
    are relevant era keys and values are [boolean] true values.

  name_to_key

    Mappings from era names to era keys.  This is a JSON object whose
    names are strings identifying the mapping and values are their
    descriptions, as JSON objects whose names are era names and values
    are corresponding era keys.

    The mapping "jp" is a mapping which should be appropriate for most
    Japanese contexts.  Now that Japan is the only country using 元号,
    this should be the global default used when the no context is
    known.

  name_to_keys

    A mapping table from era names to era keys.  Names are era names
    (i.e. values in the |era_names| list of eras) and values are JSON
    objects whose names are relevant era keys and values are [boolean]
    true values.

  numbers_in_era_names

    List of era names that contain numeric characters, characters
    representing ranges in time periods, and delimiter characters
    (i.e. characters that can cause problems when a string is to be
    parsed into an era name and a year number).  A JSON object whose
    names are numeric characters and values are list of relevant era
    names, represented as JSON objects whose names are era names and
    values are JSON objects whose names are relevant era keys and
    values are [boolean] true values.

* The |events| data type

If the value's type is |events|, i.e. it is a |starts| or |ends|
fields, its value is a JSON array of relevant events.  If there is no
event, the value can be null or omitted.

An event is a JSON object with following name/value pairs:

  day

    The day.  If an exact day is known, a [day] value.  Otherwise, a
    JSON array of start and end [day] values representing a range.

  group [string?]

    The group or city the event is relevant, for relevant |type|.

  next [string?]
  prev [string?]

    starts: The |prev| value is the key of the previous era before the
    transition represented by the event.

    ends: The |next| value is the key of the previous era after the
    transition represented by the event.
    
  type [string]

    The type of the event.

      dayretroactivated

        ends: The day before the establishment day of the |next| era.
        Same as |end_day|.

      decreed

        starts: The day the era had been officially enforced in the
        government (覆奏).

        ends: The day the |next| era was decreed.

        starts: The day the era was sent to foreign governments.

      established
      established/possible
      established/incorrect

        starts: The day the era has been defined.

        ends: The day the |next| era has been defined.

        There is at most one |established| event.  The "/possible"
        events represent other possible days, if the exact day of the
        establishment is not recorded.  The "/incorrect" events
        represent other days that had been considered as the
        establishment day but then was known as incorrect.

      proclaimed

        starts: The day the era had been announced (but not yet used).

      received

        starts: The day the era had been received by |group|.

        ends: The day the |next| era was received.

      retroactivated

        starts: The first day of the first calendar year of the era,
        retroactively considered as the start of the era.

        ends: The previous day of the |next| era's retroactivated day.

      shogunate-enforced

        starts: The day the era had been enforced (吉書始) in the
        Shogunate (幕府).

        ends: The day the |next| era was shogunate-enforced.

      succeed

        starts: The first day of the year the era was started.

* Segmented name data types

The following data types are defined by Segmented Name Strings
<https://wiki.suikawiki.org/n/Segmented%20Name%20Strings>:

  [segmented-Hiragana] segmented Hiragana name string
