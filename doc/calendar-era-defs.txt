* Structure

The file contains a JSON object with following name/value pair:

  eras [object]

    Names are era keys as used in these data files and values are
    their descriptions, represented as JSON objects with following
    name/value pairs:

      jp_emperor_era [boolean]

        Whether the era is used to represent years where no 元号 was
        officially defined and used in Japan.  Note that not all eras
        with Japanese Emperor's name have |jp_emperor_era| flag.

      jp_era [boolean]

        Whether the era is an official 元号 used in Japan but does not
        have |jp_north_era| or |jp_south_era| flag.

      jp_north_era [boolean]

        Whether the era is an official 元号 which was used by Japan's
        北朝 government (at least partially).  Note that some of eras
        also have the |jp_south_era| flag (but have different start or
        end day).  Eras with |jp_north_era| flag are not marked as
        |jp_era|.

      jp_south_era [boolean]

        Whether the era is an official 元号 which was used by Japan's
        南朝 government (at least partially).  Note that some of eras
        also have the |jp_north_era| flag (but have different start or
        end day).  Eras with |jp_north_era| flag are not marked as
        |jp_era|.

      key [string]

        The key used to identify the era in these data files.  It is
        unique within the eras described in this file.  It might or
        might not be equal to the |name| of the era.

      name [string]

        A name of the era, which can be used as a formal or long name
        of the era in the official modern spelling of the country
        where the era is (or was) used, wherever possible.

      offset [integer]

        The offset of the first year from the year AD1.  The number of
        the year in the era can be obtained by subtracting the
        |offset| from the AD year number.  Note that the offset can be
        negative.

      start_day [day?]
      start_year [year?]
      end_day [day?]
      end_year [year?]
      official_start_day [day?]
      actual_end_day [day?]
      start_gregorian_day [day?]
      end_gregorian_day [day?]
      start_julian_day [day?]
      end_julian_day [day?]
      start_kyuureki_day [day?]
      end_kyuureki_day [day?]
      north_start_day [day?]
      north_start_year [year?]
      north_official_start_day [day?]
      north_actual_end_day [day?]
      north_end_day [day?]
      north_end_year [year?]
      south_start_day [day?]
      south_start_year [year?]
      south_end_day [day?]
      south_end_year [year?]
      south_official_start_day [day?]
      south_actual_end_day [day?]

        The start and end of the era, if defined and known.

        The start or end of the era can be defined in terms of day or
        year.

        If the start or end is defined in terms of day, |start_day| or
        |end_day| is set to the value which should be used when a date
        represented in other format is converted into the era-based
        format (according to the era system "jp" for |jp_era| eras).

        If the start is defined in terms of day and the "official"
        start day is known, |official_start_day| is set to that day.
        It can be different from the |start_day| if the era was
        defined after its actual start day.

        If the end is defined in terms of day, |actual_end_day| is set
        to that day.  It can be different from the |end_day| if a new
        era had been started before the end of the |actual_end_day|.

        For eras with |jp_north_era| or |jp_south_era| flag, |north_|
        or |south_| prefixed name/value pairs are used instead, as
        their values can be different for 北朝 and 南朝.  Note that 正
        平の一統 is not reflected to these properties.  The
        |jp_north_era| flag is not set to the 正平 era.

        If the start or end is defined in terms of day, |start_year|
        or |end_year| is set to the first or last year, i.e. the year
        to which the start or end day belongs, in the "native"
        calendar used at the start or end of the era (e.g. kyuureki
        for older Japanese eras or Gregorian for newer Japanese eras).

        If the start or end is defined in terms of year, |start_year|
        or |end_year| is set to that year.

        If start or end is defined in terms of year, |start_*_day| and
        |end_*_day| name/value pairs, where * is |gregorian|,
        |julian|, or |kyuureki|, are set to the first or last days in
        those calendars.

        For values with type [day], the parameter /era/ is set to the
        era.
