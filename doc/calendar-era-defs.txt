* Structure of the era yomi source list file

The |data/calendar/era-yomi-sources.json| file contains the sources of
the Japanese era name readings.

It is a JSON object with following name/value pairs:

  eras [object]

    The names are the era IDs.  The values are JSON objects describing
    the era with the corresponding era IDs, with following name/value
    pairs:

      id [id]
      key [key]
      name [string]
      start_year [year?]

        The ID, key, name, and start year of the era.  These fields
        are copies of the fields with the same names in the
        |data/calendar/era-defs.json| file.

      yomis [object]

        The names are source IDs.  The values are the names taken from
        the sources identified by the corresponding source IDs.

        The source IDs are opaque string identifying the sources, as
        listed in the |source_ids| array.

        The values are JSON arrays, whose items are strings that are
        the Japanese readings from the source.  The items might or
        might not be sorted according to the source.

        The value strings are the text as shown in the relevant
        sources.  It might or might not be exactly same as the
        original form.  For example, Katakana letter might be replaced
        by Hiragana letters representing the same syllable.

        If the value is the empty, the name/value pair can be omitted.

      missing_yomis [array?]

        The array items are the Japanese readings from the sources,
        which are not found in the labels of the
        |data/calendar/era-defs.json|.  Any string that is apparently
        considered as incorrect and its source is not important enough
        are omitted from the file.

    Note that only eras with relevant data are listed in this file.

  source_ids [array]

    The array items are the opaque strings that identifies the sources
    of the Japanese readings.  The items are sorted in order that
    might (or might not) be good for presentation.
